Versopm .07 6/15/2013

- Working on viewport class management code.

Version .06 6/15/2013

-  Bug Fixes.
-  Added comments in the area where the viewport class management code might be.

Version .05 6/14/2013

-  Changed Screen_Entity class name to Viewport
-  Made Viewport inherit from surface rather than being a general object (Jeremy suggestion.)  This begins us thinking of viewport as an extension to pygame.
-  Moved World Viewport out the the viewport module and into the ui_elements model.  The world viewport is too specific to this game to be general.
-  A little more code cleanup.

Version .04 6/13/2013

- Deleted old code segments no longer needed and copied to old-code.txt for reference if needed.
- Doing checkin now because I'm going to workout checking the Screen_Entity class names to Viewport.


Version .03 6/12/2013

- Changed top, left variable names to x_right and y_down.  I am less confused and feel smart again.
- Implemented mini map scroll onto the screen (key press m)
- Implemented mini map scrool off the screen (key press n

Version .02 6/11/2013

- Fixed minimap issue where right side was being cut off.  This was because I wasn't converting the numbers to calculate the scale to float.

Version .01 6/11/2013

Current Implemented Features.

1.  Strategic Zoom
2.  Panning
3.  Mini Map
