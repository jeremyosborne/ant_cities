Task List.

Key
* In process
- Not Started or on hold.

-  Adjust leaf carrying position from back to the mouth.
-  Add collision detection so that entities can not run over each other.
-  Cleanup mini-map like World_Viewport (version .15)
*  Create control panel class
-  Fix ant eating to be time based (like ant hunger.)
-  experiment with full screen class
-  Multi-Process, Sim and Render Thread
-  Add "class management code for viewport to support the following functionality:
   - User input routing to the right surface. 
-  Make something like surface effects that any display port can use.
   -  Add mini map scrolling back into the game.

Version .19 7/7.2013
-  Added display box in the minimap.

Version .18 7/6/2013
-  More realistic motion added.

Version .17 7/6/2013
-  gameobjects removed; pymunk now used for 2d vector work.

Version .16 6/29/2013
-  FPS display is now a viewport inside of ui-elements.  It's also the first
   time I used colorkey.  This allowed me to pick the text on the screen
   with a transparent background.
   
Version .15 6/28/2013
-  Can now resize the game world view on the fly.  That's cool.  To make the
   change, just update the width or height.  New code added in ui_elements
   World_Viewport are setters that override those in Viewport.
-  Changed World_Viewport to no longer look at global variables.

Version .14 6/27/2013
- Fixed ant hunger to be time based (was based on time when rendered, meaning
  that ant consumed a set amount of food when the screen was rendered.
  
Version .13 6/25/2013
- Gameworld now appears to be self contained inside the world object.  All world init
  items are now inside the init of the world class.
- game module now cleaner.
  
Version .12 6/25/2013  Rewriting or re-organizing the code.
- Removed all statemachine and entities references to spiders.
- Started to move world init items into the world class.  I want the world
  to be completely self contained so I can play with python multiprocessing
  at a later date.
  

Version .11 6/20/2013

-Added class methods to viewport.

Version .10 6/19/2013

- General fixes and cleanup.
- Game_world class moved into it's own file.

Version .09 6/18/2013

- Screens now render with the Viewport Class render_viewports method  (That was
  Single functional call to render all viewports to single surface on the task
  list.)  Breaks the animated scrolling action of the minimap entrance and exit
  from the screen.
  
  
Version .08 6/16/2013

 - Added list data structure for managing viewports.
 - new experiments directory.
 
Version .07 6/15/2013

- Working on viewport class management code.

Version .06 6/15/2013

-  Bug Fixes.
-  Added comments in the area where the viewport class management code might be.

Version .05 6/14/2013

-  Changed Screen_Entity class name to Viewport
-  Made Viewport inherit from surface rather than being a general object (Jeremy suggestion.)  This begins us thinking of viewport as an extension to pygame.
-  Moved World Viewport out the the viewport module and into the ui_elements model.  The world viewport is too specific to this game to be general.
-  A little more code cleanup.

Version .04 6/13/2013

- Deleted old code segments no longer needed and copied to old-code.txt for reference if needed.
- Doing checkin now because I'm going to workout checking the Screen_Entity class names to Viewport.


Version .03 6/12/2013

- Changed top, left variable names to x_right and y_down.  I am less confused and feel smart again.
- Implemented mini map scroll onto the screen (key press m)
- Implemented mini map scrool off the screen (key press n

Version .02 6/11/2013

- Fixed minimap issue where right side was being cut off.  This was because I wasn't converting the numbers to calculate the scale to float.

Version .01 6/11/2013

Current Implemented Features.

1.  Strategic Zoom
2.  Panning
3.  Mini Map
4.  Generalized classes for windows/screens




Dribble:

If resolution changes are allowed, should their be a viewport option to
autoscale and or keep aspect ratio.
