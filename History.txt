Task List.

Key
* In process
- Not Started.

-  Turn fps display into a viewport/ui-element.
-  Create control panel class
-  experiment with full screen class
-  Multi-Process, Sim and Render Thread
*  Add "class management code for viewport to support the following functionality:
   - User input routing to the right surface. 
-  Get simulated activities like food consumption to match time and not sim beat.
-  Make something like surface effects that any display port can use.
   -  Add mini map scrolling back into the game.

Version .13 6/25/2013
- Gameworld now appears to be self contained inside the world object.  All world init
  items are now inside the init of the world class.
- game module now cleaner.
  
Version .12 6/25/2013  Rewriting or re-organizing the code.
- Removed all statemachine and entities references to spiders.
- Started to move world init items into the world class.  I want the world
  to be completely self contained so I can play with python multiprocessing
  at a later date.
  

Version .11 6/20/2013

-Added class methods to viewport.

Version .10 6/19/2013

- General fixes and cleanup.
- Game_world class moved into it's own file.

Version .09 6/18/2013

- Screens now render with the Viewport Class render_viewports method  (That was
  Single functional call to render all viewports to single surface on the task
  list.)  Breaks the animated scrolling action of the minimap entrance and exit
  from the screen.
  
  
Version .08 6/16/2013

 - Added list data structure for managing viewports.
 - new experiments directory.
 
Version .07 6/15/2013

- Working on viewport class management code.

Version .06 6/15/2013

-  Bug Fixes.
-  Added comments in the area where the viewport class management code might be.

Version .05 6/14/2013

-  Changed Screen_Entity class name to Viewport
-  Made Viewport inherit from surface rather than being a general object (Jeremy suggestion.)  This begins us thinking of viewport as an extension to pygame.
-  Moved World Viewport out the the viewport module and into the ui_elements model.  The world viewport is too specific to this game to be general.
-  A little more code cleanup.

Version .04 6/13/2013

- Deleted old code segments no longer needed and copied to old-code.txt for reference if needed.
- Doing checkin now because I'm going to workout checking the Screen_Entity class names to Viewport.


Version .03 6/12/2013

- Changed top, left variable names to x_right and y_down.  I am less confused and feel smart again.
- Implemented mini map scroll onto the screen (key press m)
- Implemented mini map scrool off the screen (key press n

Version .02 6/11/2013

- Fixed minimap issue where right side was being cut off.  This was because I wasn't converting the numbers to calculate the scale to float.

Version .01 6/11/2013

Current Implemented Features.

1.  Strategic Zoom
2.  Panning
3.  Mini Map
4.  Generalized classes for windows/screens




Dribble:

If resolution changes are allowed, should their be a viewport option to
autoscale and or keep aspect ratio.
